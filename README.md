Hi ðŸ‘‹

I'm Ben, a software engineer from Toronto.

I excel at bridging the gap between product and engineering, ensuring that engineering decisions are product-driven.

I am currently working on the following:
- Technical Lead (full-time) at Scotiabank - working on unauthenticated marketing efforts
- Instructor (part-time) at Brainstation

Previously I was an operations manager in the technology sector. I was drawn to the world of software development while working alongside the engineering team at Miovision. I am experienced building Full Stack software applications for small-to-medium organizations that solve complex problems.

I believe in building applications with the end user in mind; making sure applications are usable, useful, and accessible.
